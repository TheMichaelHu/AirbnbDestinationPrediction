# Project Proposal: Airbnb Destination Prediction
By Michael Hu and David Zhao

## Introduction
Airbnb has found great success in the past few years as way to painlessly rent out space and to find places to stay during trips. For travelers, the spaces can be as interestnig as the destination itself and the cost is much easier on the wallet. For these reasons, people can be encouraged to check out different destinations around the globe.

## Data
Airbnb has provided data on over 275000 of their users through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings). 

## Justification
Accurately predicting where a new user will book their first trip can help Airbnb provide a more personal, expedient experience and lower the time it takes for the user to book their first trip.
